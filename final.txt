Final Sprint Task: “Go Live with Real-Time, Dynamic, AI-Assisted Trading”

Goal:

By the end of this sprint, the system must:
	•	Execute live trades with real funds on pre-defined strategies
	•	Allow real-time user decisions via chatbot
	•	Perform daily autonomous trades
	•	Be paper-trade tested once before going live
	•	Include live monitoring and stop control


Sprint Timeline — Total: ~7 hours


Phase 1: System Finalization (1.5 hrs)

Objective: Clean up and confirm readiness for live mode.
	•	Refactor core main.py or bot.py to accept “live” or “paper” as a mode.
	•	Ensure risk settings (stop-loss %, max capital, trade limits) are applied.
	•	Integrate .env secrets for live trading (e.g., Alpaca/CCXT API keys).
	•	Confirm strategy logic works with real-time ticker data.


Phase 2: Paper Trade Run (1 hr)

Objective: Simulate a full trading day.
	•	Switch to paper mode, run it for 60 minutes or simulate 1-day trades.
	•	Track output to logs (/logs/paper_trade_YYYYMMDD.txt)
	•	Output expected:
	•	Entry & exit signals
	•	PnL summary
	•	Strategy trigger explanations

Phase 3: Chatbot Control Integration (1 hr)

Objective: Enable human-in-the-loop via chatbot
	•	Add chat_interface.py or connect to Telegram/Streamlit Chat UI
	•	Allow:
	•	Start/stop bot
	•	Change risk level
	•	View current PnL
	•	Ask for “why” trade is happening
	•	Log all chat interactions

Phase 4: Go Live (2 hrs)

Objective: Execute real trades using real capital (small).
	•	Switch to “live” mode, run bot with $100–$200 cap
	•	Deploy to always-on server (e.g., Render, Railway, local server)
	•	Log every trade to live_trades/YYYYMMDD.json
	•	Verify successful buy/sell orders in exchange account


Phase 5: Post-Trade Analysis + Emergency Control (1.5 hrs)

Objective: Prepare safety nets and dashboards
	•	Auto-close position if capital loss > X%
	•	Send daily summary report (PnL, trades, notes)
	•	Manual emergency shutdown via chatbot: /halt now
	•	Add live_dashboard.py or monitor.py (CLI/Streamlit OK)

Deliverables to begin trade by End of Sprint:
	•	One paper-trade log file
	•	One real trade log (with small capital)
	•	Chatbot controlling bot
	•	Dashboard/CLI report
	•	README update with full usage flow
