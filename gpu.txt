Yes, increasing GPU speed and computational power will significantly reduce training time! Here's how different hardware upgrades would impact your training:

GPU Upgrades - Most Impactful:
Current vs. Upgraded GPU Performance:
RTX 3060/4060: ~2-3x faster than integrated/basic GPU
RTX 3080/4080: ~4-6x faster
RTX 4090: ~8-12x faster
Professional GPUs (A100, H100): ~15-25x faster
Your Training Time Improvements:
Current: 45-90 minutes per stock
RTX 4060: ~15-30 minutes per stock
RTX 4080: ~8-15 minutes per stock
RTX 4090: ~4-8 minutes per stock
A100/H100: ~2-4 minutes per stock
Why GPU Matters Most for Your Code:
1. Parallel Processing:
LSTM/Transformer operations: Highly parallelizable matrix operations
Batch processing: 128 samples processed simultaneously instead of sequentially
Multi-head attention: 8 attention heads computed in parallel
2. Memory Bandwidth:
Faster VRAM: Reduces data transfer bottlenecks
Larger VRAM: Allows bigger batch sizes (128→256→512)
Better memory management: Less CPU↔GPU data copying
3. Tensor Operations:
CUDA cores: Optimized for PyTorch tensor operations
Tensor cores (RTX series): Specialized for deep learning computations
Mixed precision: Automatic optimization on newer GPUs
Other Hardware Improvements:
CPU Upgrades:
Impact: Moderate (20-40% improvement)
Benefits: Faster data preprocessing, better multi-threading
Recommendation: High core count (12+ cores) with good single-thread performance
RAM Upgrades:
Impact: Minor to moderate (10-30% improvement)
Sweet spot: 32GB+ for your workload
Benefits: Larger datasets in memory, less disk I/O
Storage (SSD):
Impact: Minor (5-15% improvement)
Benefits: Faster data loading, model checkpointing
Recommendation: NVMe SSD for data storage


Reduce LSTM layers: 4→2 layers
Reduce Transformer layers: 6→3 layers
Smaller hidden dimensions: 256→128
Fewer attention heads: 8→4
